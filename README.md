# Thema Chat
## Thema.chat is an open source platform for finding people who want to talk about the same things you want to talk about!
### Type in a topic you're interested in, and be connected to the person who wrote the exact same (not case sensitive). You can also see a random topic that someone wants to talk about. On the info page you may see how many people are online looking to chat and what the last topic entered is.
